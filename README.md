## what is chatter?
![chatter_screenshot](assets/speaking.png)
chatter is AI voice assistant made purely in python, from the UI, to the voice recognition, all made in python! chatter uses the [hackclub ai](https://ai.hackclub.com/) for responses! chatter uses local models for the tts and speech!


## how to install chatter?
i plan on releasing a standalone app for chatter for macos, windows and linux! but thats still a WIP, until you can run chatter from source!


## how to install chatter from source
### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or newer
- pip
- A working microphone (set as default for now)
- An internet connection

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/divpreeet/project-chatter.git
cd project-chatter
```
### Create a python venv (recommended)
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### On Windows 
```
venv\Scripts\Activate
```
#### On macOS or Linux

### Install other deps (according to OS)

#### Windows
no extra steps! you're good to go!

#### macOS
install portaudio
```
brew install portaudio
```
#### Linux
install portaudio dev headers and pyaudio
```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
```

### Run!
just run chatter using
```
cd main
python3 chatter.py
```
> if your using macOS run from the default terminal and allow Microphone Privelleges!


## usage
it's simple! just say 'chatter' along your message and chatter would respond!
extra stuff:
- you can also just say chatter, without saying your message, that would make chatter say 'Yes?' after which you could continue asking your message
- saying stuff like 'chatter goodbye' or anything from bye, goodbye, exit, quit, along with 'chatter' simply exits the appication
- try saying 'chatter what are you up to' for a surprise
- if your hacky and want ultimate customization, just open up the main.py and adjust the stuff that you'd want! like the wake words, end words and so on! i hope the code is readable ðŸ˜­

## customization
you can also customize the look and feel for chatter! 

### looks
just open the [config file](main/config.json) and mess with it however you want! its in simple rgb colors, and you can change everything you see!

here are some templates! to use them just copy paste the code into the file!

```jsonc
{
  "theme": "default",
  "bg_color": [23, 23, 23],
  "eye_color": [217, 217, 217],
  "tip_color": [180, 180, 180],
  "fonts": {
    "caption": "Inter.ttf",
    "caption_size": 28,
    "tip_size": 18
  },
  "tip_interval": 20
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "theme": "latte",
  "bg_color": [239, 241, 245],
  "eye_color": [76, 79, 105],
  "tip_color": [108, 111, 133],
  "fonts": {
    "caption": "Inter.ttf",
    "caption_size": 28,
    "tip_size": 18
  },
  "tip_interval": 20
}

```

```jsonc
{
  "theme": "frappe",
  "bg_color": [35, 38, 52],
  "eye_color": [115, 121, 148],
  "tip_color": [165, 173, 203],
  "fonts": {
    "caption": "Inter.ttf",
    "caption_size": 28,
    "tip_size": 18
  },
  "tip_interval": 20
}

```

```jsonc
{
  "theme": "macchiato",
  "bg_color": [36, 39, 58],
  "eye_color": [110, 115, 141],
  "tip_color": [184, 192, 224],
  "fonts": {
    "caption": "Inter.ttf",
    "caption_size": 28,
    "tip_size": 18
  },
  "tip_interval": 20
}

```
```jsonc
{
  "theme": "mocha",  
  "bg_color": [30, 30, 46],
  "eye_color": [152, 139, 162],
  "tip_color": [166, 173, 200],
  "fonts": {
    "caption": "Inter.ttf",
    "caption_size": 28,
    "tip_size": 18
  },
  "tip_interval": 20
}
```

these are just some templates, feel free to add on!

### wake + end words
you can customize the wake and end words too! instead of `chatter` you could make it `bob`, simply open the [main.py](main/main.py) and change the `WAKE_WORDS` and `END_WORDS` to whatever you want

from:
```python
WAKE_WORDS = ["chatter", "charter", "chadar", "chadda"]
END_WORDS = ["bye", "goodbye", "exit", "quit"]
```

to:
```python
WAKE_WORDS = ["bob", "bop"]
END_WORDS = ["quiet", "shut up"]
```


## troubleshooting
- Ensure your microphone is connected and set as the default input device.
- If you encounter errors related to audio or microphone access, make sure PortAudio is installed and all Python dependencies are satisfied.
- also sometimes chatter might not hear you, due to ambient noise or your microphone!
- also make sure you first `cd main` or the equiviliant for windows before running `chatter.py`

## privacy
chatter doesnt store any data, not from your voice or computer, it simply just puts together multiple python libraries and has a nice UI, no shady stuff under the hood!
